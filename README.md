Jeevan Ankur Website

Overview

This repository contains the user interface for a website I designed for an NGO named *Jeevan Ankur*. While the website is not yet hosted and still under development, the focus of this project is to showcase my strengths in UI/UX design and front-end presentation, even as I continue to build my coding skills.

Purpose

The goal of this project was to create a meaningful and purpose-driven web design as part of an academic or personal learning initiative. I chose to design the official website of an NGO to align with real-world needs and challenges. This allowed me to work with visual structure, branding, and user experience concepts in a practical context.

Tools Used

- Cursor (AI-assisted coding environment)
- HTML/CSS (customized and edited based on visual goals)
- Manual input and design decisions throughout the project

About the Development Process

While I used AI tools to assist in writing and modifying code, the final output represents my creative direction and decision-making. I invested significant time in editing, refining, and customizing the layout, color scheme, structure, and visual tone. Rather than relying on AI outputs alone, I guided and controlled every design decision to align with a specific aesthetic and purpose.

This project reflects:
- My growing interest in front-end development
- My ability to work with design tools and AI-assisted platforms
- A hands-on approach to iterative UI development
- My commitment to improving coding skills through applied learning

Current Status

- UI for key pages is complete (e.g., homepage)
- About Us page is still in progress
- The website is not hosted at this time

 kindNote to Reviewers

I am actively learning front-end development and this project represents both my progress and my design sensibility. While I may still be gaining experience with the technical side of web development, I am confident in my ability to conceptualize and implement intuitive, clean, and visually effective designs.

Thank you for reviewing this project as part of my internship application. I am passionate about design and committed to continued learning and growth.
